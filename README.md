# Predicting Used Car Price

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**Predict price of used Cars**

This project aims to predict the pricing for used carsusing machine learning models. The goal is not only to estimate prices accurately but also to identify which vehicle features have the greatest impact on value. This will help us understand what drives used car pricing and allow the business to price more competitively and prioritize high-value listings. The dataset is from Kaggle. 

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features Considered

- **Manufaturer (eg : Tesla,BMW)**
- **Odometer (Mileage)**
- **Tile Status (eg: Clean,Salvage)**
- **Drive (eg: fwd,rwd,4wd)**
- **Year**
- **fuel (eg:gas,electric)**
- **condition (eg:like new,good,fair)**
- **Type (eg: Sedan, SUV)**
- **Transmission (eg: Manual,Others)**

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- **Prioritize Newer Vehicles: Vehicle age plays a significant role in determining resale value. Newer models are attractive assets for dealerships. Dealers should aim to stock recent-year vehicles whenever possible.**

- **Monitor Odometer Readings: Mileage is directly correlated with depreciation. Vehicles with lower odometer readings retain more value, so prioritizing low-mileage cars can lead to better margins. High-mileage cars should only be considered if they can be sourced at lower costs.**

- **Consider Condition and Drive Type: A vehicleâ€™s condition (e.g., excellent, good, fair) and drive type (e.g., AWD, FWD, RWD) significantly impact buyer perception and market value.**

- **Focus on Manufacturer and Transmission: The brand (manufacturer) and transmission type (manual or automatic) also influence pricing. Well-known and reliable brands typically retain more value, and automatic transmissions are often preferred in many markets.**
